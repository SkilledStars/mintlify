## Generating your API Key

You can generate an API key through your super.fans developer portal.  All requests to the super.fans API must include an authorization header with your API key as the bearer token.

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl -X GET 'https://super.fans/api/v1/popular-keywords?dataTag=YOUR_DATATAG' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY'
```

```javascript fetch
const options = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_KEY'}
};

fetch('https://super.fans/api/v1/popular-keywords?dataTag=YOUR_DATATAG', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
</CodeGroup>
